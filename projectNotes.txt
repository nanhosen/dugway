leaving map broken. oops. untitled has working code for fdaa layer. need to figure out how to pass props to the layer to color the map layers. looked at fuel status map and did it as child inheritance but just read some react article about how that's not good, so look into inheritance vs composition. sounds like composition is better. current code has ercmap.js sending 'hi' to the fdaa layer but that prob doesn't work. well, doing it as a function not as a child thing in react so yeah. will have forgotten all of this by the time i do it again im sure.
